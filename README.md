### Step 2: Run the code
Dowload to your computer the file "run_analysis.R" and put it on your work directory in R (the same directory where you place the data file). Once you have the file in your working directory, just load it into R and that's all. You can use the commenad: source("run_analysis.R") to load the script.

While the script is running you will see some messages, at the end, the file "newTidyData.txt" will be created in the "data" directory.
